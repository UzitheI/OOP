Templates allow generic programming in c++. Through the use of templates, we can create generic classes and functions which when created once can support a long range of data types. it severly decreases code redundancy as there is no need for recreating functions with similar properties. It is similar for classes.

Function templates can be defined as functions which when created once as a generic function can handle multiple data types

class templates are similar to function templates but for class

Advantages
-reduced code redundancy
-reduced complexity 
-saves time
-code becomes more managable
