a copy constructor can be defined as the constructor which can be used to create an object from another object. 
a copy constructor can also be defined as an overloaded constructor that helps initialize an object from another object 

class myteam{
    private:
    int age;
    public:
    myteam(){
        //default constructor
    }
    myteam(int age){
        //parameterized constructor
    }
    myteam(const myteam m1){
        //copy constructor
    }
};

we call copy constructor because:
i) if we are initializing another object from an object, we use copy constructor;
ie s1=s2 where student is the class and s1 and s2 are it's objects
ii) when object of the same class is being used as the default parameter
iii)
