describe the chain of constructors and destructors in inheritance

constructors are special objects which have the similar name to the class, they are extremely important to initialize values as well as to generally know where the control of the program is

chain of constructors 

if you are creating a parent class with the first level derived class and second level derived class and you make the object of the second level derived class, you will get the constructor of the parent class called first, then the second class and then the third second level derived class, same goes for the deconstructor



to be clear:
first constructors are called, the constructors are called in the sequence of the parent to the derived and the second derived
the destructors are called at the reverse order, first destructor is called from the last derived class, then teh second derived class and finally the parent class
