1) stream: stream can be define as the flow of data, when dealing with intake and outtake of data from input and output devices, we use cin and cout.
2) 

class hierarchy
--ios: ios is the parent class for all stream functions, ie any input and output class that communicates between the user and the computer when writing a cpp file is handles by the ios stream class, also any other stream classes that target input and output of data to any source or destination, is a derived class of ios class
--filebuf: it sets the file buffer to read and write
--istream: responsible for input of data
--ostream: responsible for output of data
--fstreambase: it is a derivation of ios class but it normally handles the input and output of data in a file 
--istream: it is derived from fstreambase and it handles inputing data to the file 
--ostream: it is derived from fstreambase and it handles outputin data to the file
--withassign classes: withassign classes are used for operator overloading when iostream, istream or ostream is used. it is now removed from cpp library as it was found to be deficient
